Each branch is a different experiment

Please view the branches for more information.

- cold_diffusion2:  Using [Cold Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09392) to transform midi inputs to audio waveforms using Sashimi
- freq_diffusion2: Diffusion in the frequency domain using Sashimi
- no_diffusion: Using Sashmi without diffusion
- proll_as_mel: Using piano roll for conditional diffusion

Other branches are not in use. 

## Diffusion in Frequency

Higher frequency are added to waveforms deeper in the network in frequency diffusion. Experiments did not result in good samples.
